# --- Sensitive Files ---
# Ensure credentials.json is covered, which your current rule does.
# You can make it more specific if needed, e.g., for a root-level file:
/credentials.json
# Or for specific paths:
BugReporting/credentials.json

# If you have other sensitive configuration files
# *.secrets
# config.ini # Be careful if some parts of config.ini should be versioned
